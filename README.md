### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Justin from South Korea, and I do content on Development. 
I really enjoy studying backend and AI. When I work make website projects. I use vanilla java script and node.js and React for my projects.
In AI projects I use Python for data analysis and to train my AI model.
And you can check out my materials I studied, on my blog.
